Testing the website using a wireframe with my 'client' (boyfriend) allowed me to have a much more practical conversation about how he thought it would work. It brought to light some incorrect assumptions I was making. He identified 12 categories of engineering/manufacturing services that he wanted to have displayed on the home page:

Engineering services:
-Machine design
-Product design
-Mechanical design
-Industrial design
-Electrical design
-Tooling design

Manufacturing services:
-Laser cutting
-Water cutting
-CNC Machining
-Sheet metal/fabrication
-Electronics Assembly
-Moulding

Clicking on each of the categories would take you to a page for that category, displaying all businesses providing that category of service (plus other relevant details). He specifically wanted the businesses to be plotted on a google map to show their location.

He also wanted to crowdsource data collection, with a submit info page and a form, for adding new services.
