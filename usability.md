I didn't make any changes to my form as a result of the tutorials. While the techniques sound good, and it's obvious how they help usability (e.g. validation,  user-triggered or dynamic help, error messages) but these seem to tricky for me to code at this stage. 

I considered changing 'submit' to something less generic, but didn't, because being generic is one of the features of that particular form.
